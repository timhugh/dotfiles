# Issues

## Vim

## Bin
- [ ] Bin install script doesn't actually backup old files (because it uses absolute paths)

## Not actually issues, but still TODOs

- [ ] I'm not convinced that install script is actually safe to run...
- [ ] Reduce duplication in install scripts (backup, ln loops are essentially identical).
- [ ] Improve logging.
- [ ] Make user agnostic template for gitconfig and interpolate env variables on install.
- [ ] Install script for homebrew and packages.
- [ ] Init script for git, hub credentials.
- [ ] Init for .env file
  - [ ] Name, email for git
  - [ ] Github token for hub
  - [ ] Default ruby version
- [ ] Install powerline fonts (https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
- [ ] ???
