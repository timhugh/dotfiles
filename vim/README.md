# vimrc

## Usage

I use Vundle for vim dependencies, not because I'm deeply in love with it, but just because I didn't like Pathogen and I haven't tried anything else.
You can do the usual Vundle stuff...

```
vim +PluginInstall
```

...or you can use the handy (maybe experimental?) install script in `/install/vim.sh`.
