## What makes it better?

TL;DR: it does more than just display `git blame` annotations in the gutter ‚Äì it helps you visualise the blame info including the age of the code.

**A rich popover displays summary info about the commit and visualises the commit's age.**

**Line highlighting makes it clear which other lines were introduced by the blame commit.**

Oh and it's also fast and nicely designed.

## How do I use it?

Use `ctrl-b`  to toggle the blame gutter.

Alternatively, right click the file you want to blame and select `Toggle Better Git Blame`, or search for this command in the [command palette](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#command-palette) (`cmd-shift-p`).

Hover over the blame text to display the popover & line highlighting.

## How do I get setup?

Run `apm install better-git-blame` and restart Atom. You can also install it from Atom's Settings pane.
